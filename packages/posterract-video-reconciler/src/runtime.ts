/**
 * What a compiled bundle sees as "@posterract/composition".
 *
 * The npm package under that name is authoring-only — types, pure helpers, and
 * hooks that throw because they have no host to read. A project never resolves
 * it from node_modules at runtime: the desktop compile marks the specifier
 * external (`moduleName` for babel-preset-solid's universal transform), and
 * `evaluate` binds it to this object instead. So the module a project imports
 * is the authoring surface with the host-bound implementations layered over
 * it: the renderer's element operations, the compile-target components, and
 * live `useTicker` in place of the throwing declaration.
 *
 * Order matters — the renderer bindings must come last so they win.
