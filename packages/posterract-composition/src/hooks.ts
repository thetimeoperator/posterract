 * The authoring hooks, as signatures. They read the host a project is mounted
 * into, which only exists inside the editor: when a project is mounted, the
 * renderer substitutes its own "@posterract/composition" module (see
 * @posterract/video-reconciler) and these implementations are replaced by ones
 * bound to the live host. This package carries the declarations so project
 * sources type-check and get IntelliSense; calling them outside a mount
 * throws rather than silently returning a dead value.

/**
 * Subscribes to the project's timeline: the playhead of the scene the mount's
 * root lives in (or is), pushed by the host once per playback tick. Each
 * accessor only propagates when its value changes, so a paused scene re-runs
 * nothing and `frame()` consumers update at most once per frame. Values move
 * while the reactive graph is alive: a mount stays live, and export, capture,
 * and reload each re-execute the module and drive the ticker themselves.
 *
 * `hold` is the other half of that: because a mount of its own is what an
 * export or a capture draws, a project's own async work (a mesh, a texture,
 * a fetch a layout is decided by) races the first frames, which are sampled
 * as soon as the module has rendered. Handing the promise to `hold` keeps
 * those frames waiting for it. Live playback collects nothing, so a held
 * promise costs the editor nothing.
