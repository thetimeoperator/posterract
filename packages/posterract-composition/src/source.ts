 * them import each other, and nothing here touches a file or a host.
 *
 * It exists so that a change made on the canvas can be written back to the JSX
 * that produced it: the compile step stamps every composition element with
 * where it came from, the host keeps that stamp on the entity it builds, and
 * the editor hands it back when it wants the source changed.

 * Attribute an element may carry to name itself. An id outlives edits that
 * renumber the file, so it — not the element's position — is what an entity
 * holds once its element has one. It is also how elements point at each other
 * within a render: `syncTo` names the id of the clip it aligns against.
 *
 * Yours to write: an id is any string, and `id="hero"` is worth more to read
 * than anything generated. The editor only stamps elements that have none, and
 * renaming one by hand is safe. Stripped at compile time, so it never reaches
 * a host as a prop; what survives is `SOURCE_ATTR`, which carries it.

 * one at a time; the loop stamp is what lets the editor tell that, gather the

 * the author actually wrote. The stamp is what lets those pieces be gathered
 * back under the name they were written as.
