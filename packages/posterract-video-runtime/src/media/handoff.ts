// Handing a primed decoder from a node to the copy that takes over from it.
// A decoder is the expensive part of playing a clip — a demuxer, a decode
// queue, and the frames around wherever it was last seeked — and a copy that
// carries on from where the original stops wants exactly the state the
// original has. Rebuilding it there means a seek, and a blank frame while the
// seek lands; moving the handle means the copy draws its first frame from the
// cache that was already warm for it.

/**
 * Moves the live video decoders of `from`'s subtree to `to`'s.
 *
 * For a split: the original ends at the playhead and the copy starts there,
 * so the copy is what renders next and the original is the one that can
 * afford to rebuild (`resolveVideoDecoder` gives it a fresh decoder whenever
 * it is played again). Both halves read the same source frames at the same
 * scene frames — the cut leaves their origins and playback rates alone — so
 * the decoder arrives already seeked to where it is wanted.
 *
 * Audio is left where it is: its decoder is scheduled against the audio graph
 * rather than seeked per frame, and both halves are heard.
