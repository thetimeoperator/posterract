 * clips win and keep their full extent; later clips yield, trimmed back to start
 * after the clip preceding them (fully-covered clips are removed).
 *
 * Children are processed in start-frame order with each one authoritative over
 * all later siblings. Because every authoritative pass trims *all* later
 * siblings uniformly, each clip's start stays monotonic by rank, so the "dropped
 * clip lands inside a sibling" split case from resolveEntityOverlap cannot arise
