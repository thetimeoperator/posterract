// Write-path actions (was api/*). Plain world-first functions, matching the
// queries/systems convention, rather than koota createActions: actions here
// return entities/records and call each other freely, which the bound-record
// pattern only obscures. No history or persistence layer: the app records
// undo entries and schedules writes by observing koota add/remove/change
// events on the traits these actions touch.
