// The asset model. An asset is a manifest record (see ./manifest.ts) plus a
// runtime handle to its bytes, attached by the AssetLibrary. Everything an
// asset *is* lives in the record: what the file was found to be (probe
// results), where its bytes are (`source`), and where the project keeps it in
// the library (`path`). Its `id` is a content hash, so the same bytes imported
// twice are one asset, and a relinked file keeps its metadata.
