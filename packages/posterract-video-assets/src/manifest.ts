// The asset manifest: the project's record of its library. On desktop it is
// `assets.yml` at the project root (the main process converts to and from
// YAML); elsewhere the same shape as JSON. It holds what cannot be derived
// from the files themselves — which files belong to the project, where the
// project keeps them (`path`), where their bytes are (`source`), and what
// they were found to be — so opening a project never re-probes footage that
// has not changed.
