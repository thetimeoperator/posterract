/**
 * The timeline's own canvas, on the world beside the stage's own
 * (`RenderSurface`). A second surface rather than a second world: the
 * timeline shows the same entities the canvas does, only against time
 * instead of space.
 *
 * Interaction here is immediate-mode — a render function asks the pointer
 * about the rectangle it is about to draw and acts on the answer in the same
 * breath (see `./pointer`). That is not how the stage works, where the render
 * pass leaves `HitRegions` behind for the input system to dispatch against;
 * the difference is that a clip's rectangle *is* the drawing, so naming it a
 * second time buys nothing.
 *
 * Held as one mutable object rather than a trait of fields, since a render
 * pass writes to it as it goes (which row it is in, what the cursor should
 * be) and none of it is worth an event.
