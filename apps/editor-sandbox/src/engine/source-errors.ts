/**
 * A failed generation, written back to the JSX that asked for it. The runtime
 * leaves the reason on the entity (`SourceError`); this is what turns it into
 * the `error` prop of the element, so the failure lives where the rest of the
 * document lives — in the file — rather than only in the session that saw it.
 *
 * That is what keeps a generation from being run again: the project remounts
 * on every edit and is compiled afresh on every reload, and each time the
 * element carries the answer its declaration already got (see the asset
 * system, which leaves such an element alone). Taking the prop off the
 * element — in the file, like any other authored change — is what asks for
 * the run again; nothing else in the editor does it silently.
 *
 * Only generations are written: a load that failed is cheap to try again, and
 * an asset that has since been put back should simply load.
