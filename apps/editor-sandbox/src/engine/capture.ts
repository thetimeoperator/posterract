/**
 * The world an encode runs against: the project rendered a second time, into
 * a world of its own, reduced to the one node being encoded.
 *
 * Rendered rather than copied, because a copy of the entities is only what
 * the composition holds as data — a `<surface>`'s drawing, an `<html>`
 * subtree and every value a `useTicker` memo feeds live in the node the
 * project's render made, and the offline world has to have its own. So the
 * bundle that is on the canvas is mounted again here, against an offline
 * world at the export's frame rate, and the encoder is handed the result.
 *
 * The whole project renders, not the one scene: a scene is not a project, and
 * what each of them holds is only known by running the whole thing. The stage
 * is reduced to the scene straight after, before a system has looked at any
 * of it, so nothing outside it is ever drawn, decoded, mixed or advanced, nor
 * is any `src` of it resolved.
