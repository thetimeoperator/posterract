 * Where a node sits on the timeline, moved the way every editor change moves:
 * the document for the canvas, an edit for the file. The runtime has
 * `trimEntityIn`/`trimEntityOut`, which write Delay/Trim themselves — that
 * moves the clip on screen and nowhere else — so everything that trims a clip
 * (the inspector's fields, the timeline's handles, a split) goes through here
 * instead, and the file hears about it.
 *
 * The runtime no longer stores the file's time vocabulary: it reconciles
 * `start`/`end`/`sourceIn`/`sourceOut` down to Delay and Trim. What a node
 * authors is read back from the copy its host node keeps (`authoredTime`),
 * which is what these edits rewrite.
