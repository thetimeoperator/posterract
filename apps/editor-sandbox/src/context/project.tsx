// The open project, for everything that acts on it. A project is three names
// at once and they come apart: the id is what it *is* (the URL, the key the
// world is under), the folder is where it lives (and moves, when the project
// is renamed), and the display name is what the user calls it. Resolving the
// URL to a project happens once, in ProjectPage; this is that answer, kept
// current as the project is renamed underneath the editor.
