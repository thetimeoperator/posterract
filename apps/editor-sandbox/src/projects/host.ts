// Renderer half of on-disk projects. Projects live as folders under a root
// (persisted) — a default one until the user picks another; each project's
// package.json is its record (`projectId`, `displayName`, `main`). The
// desktop main process scans, scaffolds, renames, copies, trashes, compiles,
// and watches them. Desktop only for now: without the bridge every call
// rejects and the root is null.
//
// A project is addressed by its folder — an absolute path, which is what main
// takes — and identified by its id, which is what the app's URLs carry and
// what survives the folder being renamed. `resolveProject` is the one bridge
// between the two; callers get the folder from the `ProjectInfo` it answers
// with (and the open project's from `@/context/project`).
